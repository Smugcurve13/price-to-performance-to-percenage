PC Price-to-Performance Comparison Tool (Alpha Version)
Overview
This program calculates the price-to-performance ratio of two PCs, allowing users to make a data-driven comparison of which PC offers better value for money. It takes the price and performance metrics of two PCs and outputs how much one is more cost-effective than the other, making it easier to decide which machine is the best bang for your buck.

Features
Calculates the price-to-performance ratio for two PCs.
Compares both ratios to determine which PC offers better value for money.
Outputs the difference in performance value between the two machines.
Provides clear, factual data to help users make informed purchasing decisions.
How It Works
The program accepts input for the price and performance metrics (e.g., benchmark scores) of two PCs.
It calculates the price-to-performance ratio for both PCs by dividing the price by the performance score.
The program then compares the ratios and outputs which PC offers a better price-to-performance ratio.
It also gives a percentage comparison to show how much one PC is more efficient in terms of cost-effectiveness.
Example
Suppose we have two PCs:

PC1

Price: $524
Performance: 36,660 (benchmark score)
PC2

Price: $570
Performance: 39,012 (benchmark score)
The program calculates the price-to-performance ratio for each PC and determines which one is better value for money.

Example output:

vbnet
Copy code
PC1 Price-to-Performance: 0.014292
PC2 Price-to-Performance: 0.014612
PC1 has a better price-to-performance ratio: 0.014292
In this case, PC1 is slightly better in terms of price-to-performance.

Installation & Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
Run the program using the command:
bash
Copy code
python pc_comparison.py
The program will automatically calculate and display the price-to-performance ratios for the two PCs you provide.
Future Improvements
Input validation for user inputs.
Dynamic input of PC specifications (not hardcoded).
Support for more than two PCs in the comparison.
Graphical interface for easier usage.
