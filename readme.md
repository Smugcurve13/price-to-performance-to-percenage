# PC Price-to-Performance Comparison Tool (Alpha Version)

## Overview
This program calculates the price-to-performance ratio of two PCs, allowing users to make a data-driven comparison of which PC offers better value for money. It takes the price and performance metrics of two PCs and outputs how much one is more cost-effective than the other, making it easier to decide which machine is the best bang for your buck.

## Features
- Calculates the price-to-performance ratio for two PCs.
- Compares both ratios to determine which PC offers better value for money.
- Outputs the difference in performance value between the two machines.
- Provides clear, factual data to help users make informed purchasing decisions.

## How It Works
1. The program accepts input for the price and performance metrics (e.g., benchmark scores) of two PCs.
2. It calculates the price-to-performance ratio for both PCs by dividing the price by the performance score.
3. The program then compares the ratios and outputs which PC offers a better price-to-performance ratio.
4. It also gives a percentage comparison to show how much one PC is more efficient in terms of cost-effectiveness.

## Example
Suppose we have two PCs:

### PC1
- **Price:** $524
- **Performance:** 36,660 (benchmark score)

### PC2
- **Price:** $570
- **Performance:** 39,012 (benchmark score)

The program calculates the price-to-performance ratio for each PC and determines which one is better value for money.

### Example Output:
PC1 Price-to-Performance: 0.014292 PC2 Price-to-Performance: 0.014612 PC1 has a better price-to-performance ratio: 0.014292


In this case, PC1 is slightly better in terms of price-to-performance.
