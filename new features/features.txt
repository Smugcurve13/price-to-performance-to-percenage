4. Use Case : I have to define use case for different parts of pc components,
 for ex, gaming, photoshop, premier pro, coding LLM building crypto

5. Database Creation : data of performance metrics 
(
making a component based item list for ex flow would be 
enter cpu name
show performance metrics that can be added
which performance metric to add 
writing in csv /json whichever feels better
can consider sql later but might hinder in a webapp capacity
)

6: Parts compatibility with each other: making sure that the parts we have 
accumulated are in sync with each other and there is no discrepancy

7: TDP and Temperature: checking how much power is drawn from the parts 
and how much it heats up in optimal conditions

8: Future Upgradability: correlates the cpu, gpu, ram with the mobo and gives 
output based on what future generation of components can you pc support 

9. Overclocking Support : checking if your given components such as cpu gpu ram monitor 
supports overclocking, add a warning message that you are doing it at your own risk and
may void your warranty so be cautious. 

10. Display Support: How many monitors, their refresh rate and resolution do your 
computer support
